## What is this?
Coding is not cooking. It's not a simple matter of reading a recipe and heating up some pans in order to deliver a steaming hot plate. Coding requires a lot of problem solving, planning, and step by step effort. Developing in ServiceNow is no different, despite how the platform is packaged and the training is delivered. Don't get me wrong -- the speed with which ServiceNow customers can deliver value using the platform has a lot do with how modules (such as Incident, Service Catalog, HR) are packaged, and the training that is available both on the developer.servicenow.com website and through ServiceNow's learning programs keeps things tight in a way that really helps with that speed of delivery.

But work in the real world comes in the form of projects, and no matter what the development platform is that you're hired to sweat over your greatest leaps of learning will come in for of projects. Not class modules.
