# About the book
ServiceNow Inside and Out is a technical guide for developers wishing to build their skills in developing on the ServiceNow platform. It is a project-driven approach to solving complex problems on the platform, and for the most part it is very code-centric.

This is not a guide for implementors, nor is it a platform feature deep dive for business analysts. It is a bit messy, and it is decidedly complicated.

The contents of the book are built as Knowledge Base articles so as to resemble documents one might actually be using in ServiceNow. The projects are organized as Epics and Stories so that they look at a lot like the kind of work a development would get paid to complete.

## What is the motivation for this kind of book
Coding is not cooking. It's not a simple matter of reading a recipe and heating up some pans in order to deliver a steaming hot plate. Coding requires a lot of problem solving, planning, and step by step effort. Developing in ServiceNow is no different, despite how the platform is packaged and the training is delivered. Don't get me wrong -- the speed with which ServiceNow customers can deliver value using the platform has a lot to do with how modules (such as Incident, Service Catalog, HR) are packaged, and the training that is available both on the developer.servicenow.com website and through ServiceNow's learning programs keeps things tight in a way that really helps with that speed of delivery.

But to know this platform you have to stick your hands in the clay and make something, and when it comes to coding sticking your hands in the clay means building projects. There are plenty of learning theory reasons why this is true, but if you have any experience with technology at all I'm sure you know it is true instinctively. Memorizing syntax and reciting the 'right' structure for something like a method is boring and hard to do. Fumbling your way through making something can be challenging, too, but it's fun and has a built in ability to motivate.

ServiceNow provides us with a unique kind of project playground. There are many completed projects already built into the platform that the good people at ServiceNow have invested a ton of time and effort into providing for us. These are the 'out of the box' components that can often be delivered as-is with little configuration. Most of it needs a little tweaking, however, in order for things to work the way a company needs them to work. 

This is why this book is broken down into 'from the inside' and 'from the outside' projects. First we will take a few out of the box modules in the platform and modify them in order to learn how their component parts work. This is a great way to achieve some situational awareness about the development tools available in ServiceNow.

The second half of the box colors outside the lines. Using the development tools available to us we will build some projects that create functionality that does not already exist. The things I have chosen to include may be useful as they are for some organizations, but their inclusion here is not really intended to provide a blueprint for building these things exactly. It's all about having projects that teach you ServiceNow development.
