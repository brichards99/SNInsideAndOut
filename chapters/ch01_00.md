# Notes to Get Started

ServiceNow is a big world, and it can be confusing to wade into this territory with out a bit of orientation. We will begin this book with a look at the history of ServiceNow, the tools that a developer has to work with, and some sense of how a person becomes credentialed in working on the product.

While I feel confident of the longevity of the material in much of the rest of the book, there are number of things described in this first section that might change rapidly. ServicecNow has proven its dedication to updating its materials and resources for both customers and developers, so what is presented here may change and evolve rather quickly.


## History of ServiceNow (gemerated)

ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform that provides software solutions for IT service management (ITSM), IT operations management (ITOM), and IT business management (ITBM). The company was founded in 2004 by Fred Luddy, an industry veteran who previously worked at Peregrine Systems, a software company that was involved in a major accounting scandal.

### Early Years (2004-2007)

ServiceNow was initially launched as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering for IT service management. The company's first product was the ServiceNow IT Service Management Suite, which allowed IT departments to automate their workflows and streamline their service delivery processes. The product was designed to be easy to use and highly customizable, allowing customers to tailor it to their specific needs.

In its early years, ServiceNow focused primarily on the IT service management market, targeting large enterprises that were looking to replace their legacy IT service management systems with a more modern, cloud-based solution. The company's early customers included the US Department of Energy, Qualcomm, and General Electric.

### Growth Years (2008-2012)

In 2008, ServiceNow raised $65 million in venture capital funding from investors such as JMI Equity, Sequoia Capital, and Greylock Partners. The funding allowed the company to accelerate its growth and expand into new markets.

During this period, ServiceNow continued to focus on the IT service management market, but also began to develop new products and expand into new markets. In 2010, the company launched the ServiceNow IT Operations Management Suite, which provided tools for managing infrastructure and operations. In 2011, the company launched the ServiceNow IT Business Management Suite, which provided tools for managing project portfolios and financials.

By 2012, ServiceNow had more than 1,200 customers and was generating over $100 million in annual revenue. The company went public in June of that year, raising $210 million in its initial public offering (IPO).

### Expansion Years (2013-2017)

Following its IPO, ServiceNow continued to expand its product portfolio and enter new markets. In 2013, the company launched the ServiceNow HR Service Delivery Suite, which provided tools for managing HR service delivery processes. In 2014, the company launched the ServiceNow Customer Service Management Suite, which provided tools for managing customer service processes.

ServiceNow also began to expand its global footprint during this period, opening new offices in Europe, Asia, and Australia. In 2015, the company opened a development center in Hyderabad, India, which has since become one of its largest development centers outside of the United States.

In 2017, ServiceNow surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue, and had more than 3,000 customers worldwide.

### Transformation Years (2018-Present)

In recent years, ServiceNow has undergone a significant transformation, shifting its focus from IT service management to digital workflows. In 2018, the company launched the Now Platform, a cloud-based platform that allows customers to create and automate digital workflows across a wide range of business functions.

The Now Platform has become the centerpiece of ServiceNow's product portfolio, and the company has invested heavily in developing new applications and integrations for the platform. In 2019, the company acquired the cognitive search engine provider Attivio, which it used to enhance the search capabilities of the Now Platform. In 2020, the company acquired the configuration management database (CMDB) provider Sweagle, which it used to enhance the configuration management capabilities of the Now Platform.

Today, ServiceNow is one of the fastest-growing enterprise software companies in the world, with more than 6,000 customers and annual revenue of over $5 billion. The company's customers include some of the world's largest enterprises, such as Bank of
