# Notes to Get Started

ServiceNow is a big world, and it can be confusing to wade into this territory with out a bit of orientation. We will begin this book with a look at the history of ServiceNow, the tools that a developer has to work with, and some sense of how a person becomes credentialed in working on the product.

While I feel confident of the longevity of the material in much of the rest of the book, there are number of things described in this first section that might change rapidly. ServicecNow has proven its dedication to updating its materials and resources for both customers and developers, so what is presented here may change and evolve rather quickly.
