## History of ServiceNow (generated)

ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform that provides software solutions for IT service management (ITSM), IT operations management (ITOM), and IT business management (ITBM). The company was founded in 2004 by Fred Luddy, an industry veteran who previously worked at Peregrine Systems, a software company that was involved in a major accounting scandal.

### Early Years (2004-2007)

ServiceNow was initially launched as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering for IT service management. The company's first product was the ServiceNow IT Service Management Suite, which allowed IT departments to automate their workflows and streamline their service delivery processes. The product was designed to be easy to use and highly customizable, allowing customers to tailor it to their specific needs.

In its early years, ServiceNow focused primarily on the IT service management market, targeting large enterprises that were looking to replace their legacy IT service management systems with a more modern, cloud-based solution. The company's early customers included the US Department of Energy, Qualcomm, and General Electric.

### Growth Years (2008-2012)

In 2008, ServiceNow raised $65 million in venture capital funding from investors such as JMI Equity, Sequoia Capital, and Greylock Partners. The funding allowed the company to accelerate its growth and expand into new markets.

During this period, ServiceNow continued to focus on the IT service management market, but also began to develop new products and expand into new markets. In 2010, the company launched the ServiceNow IT Operations Management Suite, which provided tools for managing infrastructure and operations. In 2011, the company launched the ServiceNow IT Business Management Suite, which provided tools for managing project portfolios and financials.
