## Client Script

So there is no doubt, Client Scripts run JavaScript on the client, and are strictly limited to client-side APIs like GlideForm, GlideRecord, and GlideUser. Generally speaking the purpose of any new client script you build should be to manipulate the user's experience in the browser, but not the state of data in the tables on the platform. There is certainly some grey area, but in the spirit of building supportable code this is the general mindset one should use.

Common patterns for the use of Client Scripts are associated with the script types available.

#### onLoad()

Manipulate the form to show only the right fields (and field options) for the current situation
Manipulate the form to restrict behavior (such as editability) based on the current situation
Show messages to users based on just in time situations (rather than messages that should always be present)

#### onChange()

Validate field data to provide timely feedback to the user regarding inputs
Manipulate the form to show only the right fields or to restrict further behavior based on the choices a user just made

#### onSubmit()

Validate field data based on a comprehensive picture of the entire record that the user is attempting to submit or update

### Developer Roadmap

Before creating any client script the developer should consider the following:


### A typical onLoad() client script

Name: Make Parent field read-only
Table: Risk
UI Type: All
Type: onLoad()

Script:

function onLoad() {

   if(g_form.getValue('task'))
		g_form.setReadOnly("task",true);
}


### A typical onChange() client script

Name: Make Parent field read-only
Table: Risk
UI Type: All
Type: onLoad()

Script:
```
   function onLoad() {

      if(g_form.getValue('task'))
		   g_form.setReadOnly("task",true);
   }
```

## Client Script Good Practices

1. Use the GlideForm API: Use the GlideForm API instead of using jQuery or DOM manipulation for updating the form elements. This API provides an easy way to update the form elements without causing any issues with other scripts or form validation.

2. Use the right event: Use the right event for the script. The best way to determine which event to use is to read the documentation for each event and determine which one fits the requirement.

3. Limit script execution: Avoid running the script multiple times by setting conditions to limit script execution. For example, use a global variable or a condition to check if the script has already run on the page.

4. Optimize for performance: Optimize client scripts for performance by minimizing the number of requests to the server. Use asynchronous functions and avoid making calls to the server unnecessarily.

5. Handle errors: Always handle errors and exceptions gracefully in client scripts. Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and display appropriate error messages to the users.

6. Follow naming conventions: Follow naming conventions for client script variables, functions, and files. Use meaningful and descriptive names that are easy to understand.

7. Test thoroughly: Test the client scripts thoroughly before deploying them to production. Test them on different browsers, devices, and scenarios to ensure they work correctly in all cases.

8. Document your code: Document your client scripts by adding comments and explanations to the code. This will help other developers understand the code and maintain it in the future.
