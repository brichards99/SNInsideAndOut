## Client Script

So there is no doubt, Client Scripts run JavaScript on the client, and are strictly limited to client-side APIs like GlideForm, GlideRecord, and GlideUser. Generally speaking the purpose of any new client script you build should be to manipulate the user's experience in the browser, but not the state of data in the tables on the platform. There is certainly some grey area, but in the spirit of building supportable code this is the general mindset one should use.

Common patterns for the use of Client Scripts are associated with the script types available.

#### onLoad()

Manipulate the form to show only the right fields (and field options) for the current situation
Manipulate the form to restrict behavior (such as editability) based on the current situation
Show messages to users based on just in time situations (rather than messages that should always be present)

#### onChange()

Validate field data to provide timely feedback to the user regarding inputs
Manipulate the form to show only the right fields or to restrict further behavior based on the choices a user just made

#### onSubmit()

Validate field data based on a comprehensive picture of the entire record that the user is attempting to submit or update

### Developer Roadmap

Before creating any client script the developer should consider the following:


### A typical onLoad() client script

Name: Make Parent field read-only
Table: Risk
UI Type: All
Type: onLoad()

Script:

function onLoad() {

   if(g_form.getValue('task'))
		g_form.setReadOnly("task",true);
}

   if(g_form.getValue('task'))
		g_form.setReadOnly("task",true);
}
