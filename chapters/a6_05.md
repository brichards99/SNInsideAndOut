# Project: To-Do App

## Good Practices

* Plan custom apps with future enhancements in mind
* Consider forms and lists carefully when setting up custom tables

## The Project

The goal for this project is simple: we want to build a simple to-do list application in ServiceNow.

The client has listed the following ten requirements for the creation of a to-do list application:

1. The application should allow users to create multiple lists with different categories or themes, such as work, personal, grocery, etc.
2. The application should enable users to easily add new tasks to their lists, including a title and description of the task.
3. The application should allow users to set due dates and reminders for their tasks to help them stay on track and avoid missing deadlines.
4. The application should allow users to mark tasks as completed and archive them for future reference.
5. The application should allow users to prioritize tasks by setting a level of importance or urgency for each task.
6. The application should enable users to search for tasks within their lists using keywords or filters.
7. The application should provide users with the ability to share their lists and tasks with others, such as friends or colleagues, for collaborative purposes.
8. The application should allow users to customize the look and feel of their lists, such as changing the color scheme or font style.
9. The application should provide users with feedback on their progress, such as a summary of completed tasks or a progress bar indicating how many tasks are left to complete.
10. The application should be accessible and user-friendly, with intuitive navigation and clear instructions for new users.

## Project Alternatives

From this we can plan three different projects:

* Develop a Global Scope application meeting these requirements.
* Develop a Scoped application meeting these requirements.
* Build a Service Portal widget implementing these requirements (and associated with the Scoped App created above)
* Develop a UI Builder application meeting these requirements.
* Create an Agent Workspace interface meeting these requirements.
