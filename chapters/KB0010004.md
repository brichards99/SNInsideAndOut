## The building blocks

In ServiceNow, developers can use various script objects to create and customize business logic, automate tasks, and extend the functionality of the platform. Some of the main script objects available in ServiceNow include:

Server-side scripting: This includes the following script objects:

Business Rules: These are scripts that run on the server when a record is inserted, updated, or deleted.
Script Includes: These are reusable code modules that can be called from other server-side scripts or client-side scripts.
Scheduled Jobs: These are scripts that can be scheduled to run at specific times or intervals.
UI Actions: These are scripts that can be triggered from the UI to perform actions on records.

Client-side scripting: This includes the following script objects:

Client Scripts: These are scripts that run on the client-side browser when a form is loaded or submitted.
UI Policies: These are scripts that can control field visibility, read-only status, and mandatory requirements on a form.
UI Scripts: These are scripts that can be used to customize the UI by adding fields, buttons, or other UI elements.
Events: This includes the following script objects:
Event Scripts: These are scripts that can be triggered when an event occurs, such as a record being inserted, updated, or deleted.
Script Actions: These are scripts that can be triggered from other scripts to perform a specific action.
Each of these script objects provides a powerful way for ServiceNow developers to create custom business logic and automate tasks within the platform. By leveraging these script objects, developers can extend the functionality of ServiceNow to meet the unique needs of their organization.

## Update Sets

In ServiceNow, an Update Set is a container for changes made to the instance that can be moved between different ServiceNow instances. It is used to capture a set of configuration changes made in a particular instance of ServiceNow, and can then be exported and imported into another instance. This allows developers to easily move their configurations and customizations between development, testing, and production instances of ServiceNow.

An Update Set can include various types of changes, such as updates to tables, fields, forms, workflows, scripts, and other ServiceNow objects. Once the changes have been made and added to an Update Set, it can be exported as an XML file, which can then be imported into another ServiceNow instance.

Update Sets are an important feature of ServiceNow because they allow developers to work on multiple instances of ServiceNow simultaneously and ensure consistency across different instances. For example, a developer can work on configuring a new IT service in a development instance of ServiceNow, and then export the changes as an Update Set and import it into the production instance of ServiceNow.

Overall, Update Sets provide an efficient and controlled way to manage changes across multiple instances of ServiceNow, making it easier for developers to maintain the integrity and consistency of the system.

## Application Scopes

In ServiceNow, an application scope is a logical container for applications, modules, tables, and other objects. It provides a way to organize and separate customizations and configurations within a ServiceNow instance, allowing different teams or departments to work on their own applications and configurations without interfering with each other.

Each application scope has its own namespace, which ensures that the objects created within that scope do not conflict with objects in other scopes. This makes it possible to have multiple applications or customizations within a single ServiceNow instance without causing conflicts or issues.

Application scopes also provide a way to control access to specific applications and configurations. By assigning users or groups to specific application scopes, administrators can ensure that users only have access to the applications and data they need, while keeping sensitive data and configurations secure.

Overall, application scopes are an important feature of ServiceNow that help to organize and manage complex configurations and customizations within a single instance, while also ensuring that data and configurations are kept secure and separate from each other.
