# Planning custom applications in global

ServiceNow is naturally much more than a simple ticketing or even a fancy workflow application: it's a platform. As a software development platform it provides us with a pretty hefty toolkit with which to build custom applications to meet our users' needs, but with that wide range of capabilities comes a wide range of ways to make something poorly. Before I start a new project a handful of aphorisms come to mind.

Failing to plan is the same as planning to fail.

For a multi-user work-oriented environment like this where records can stack up quickly and customizations stack up quickly I recommend a balanced approach to designing applications based on the following principles:

## The application should be appropriately accessible
Roles and Groups are planned for and included by design
Form layouts and views are chosen carefully based on user feedback
Access Control Rules are used deliberately in combination with the above
Field names, Labels, and Help text are planned with the needs of users in mind
Fulfiller interface, mobile access, and Service Portal access are all considered as part of the design process

## The design is made functional from the user's perspective

## The applications is supportable
Code is documented
