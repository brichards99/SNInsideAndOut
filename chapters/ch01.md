## ServiceNow Overview

Developers come to ServiceNow from many backgrounds, and the experiences we may have had in other development contexts might lead to a bit of confusion when getting started here. Some of the unique things about this platform are:

* ServiceNow uses many different development tools, including Java (behind the scenes), JavaScript, Jelly, Angular, and HTML. A few others may be integrated with the platform in order to get enhanced functionality.
* This is a multiple-instance, single tenant environment that is typically hosted on ServiceNow's own servers.
* Development on an instance is typically iterative and transported from one instance to another via change records rather than as code objects. (Much more on this later.)
* The 'product' a customer purchases from ServiceNow includes both the underlying development platform and various ready-built modules of functionality.
* The core purpose of the platform is to deliver IT Service Management capabilities to an organization, and a lot of how things are built reflect this.
