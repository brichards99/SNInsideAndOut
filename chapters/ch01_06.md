## Kanban

Kanban is a workflow management method that helps organizations manage and improve work systems. The Kanban approach suits almost every team and goal. It helps you manage the flow of tasks as your team works toward shared objectives. This method keeps track of documents, information about your tasks, and makes them accessible exactly when you need them. 

The term Kanban originates from Toyota’s “just-in-time” production system, which means doing “only what is needed, when it is needed, and in the amount needed.” The purpose of Kanban is to eliminate wasteful work, inconsistencies, and unreasonable requirements. By applying the Kanban approach to project management, the workflow becomes fully transparent and visual. Each team member can see who works on a particular task, what is being worked on, and so on. As a result, your teams can focus on the right tasks, and you won’t exceed their capacity.

A Kanban board is a physical or digital project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency or flow. In a Kanban board, tasks are represented as cards that move through stages of work represented as columns. The most basic Kanban board might have columns like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.” Each column is filled with visual cards that represent individual tasks. A team moves through the columns until the tasks are completed.
