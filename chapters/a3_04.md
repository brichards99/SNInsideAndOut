## Business Rules

In ServiceNow, Business Rules are used to automate processes and enforce data consistency across the platform. They are server-side scripts that execute when a record is inserted, updated, or deleted, or when a table is queried. Business Rules can be used to enforce business logic, perform data validation, set default values, and perform other actions based on specific conditions.

Here are some common use cases for Business Rules in ServiceNow:

* Enforcing data consistency: Business Rules can be used to enforce data consistency across the platform by validating data entered into a record and ensuring that it meets specific criteria. For example, you can use a Business Rule to ensure that a date field is always entered in a specific format, or to ensure that a field is never left blank.

* Automating processes: Business Rules can be used to automate processes and reduce the amount of manual intervention required. For example, you can use a Business Rule to automatically assign a ticket to a specific group based on the category selected by the user.

* Setting default values: Business Rules can be used to set default values for fields when a new record is created. For example, you can use a Business Rule to automatically set the priority of a ticket to 'low' when it is created.

* Triggering notifications: Business Rules can be used to trigger notifications when specific conditions are met. For example, you can use a Business Rule to send an email notification to a manager when an employee submits a request for time off.

### Update

Here's an example of an Update Business Rule in ServiceNow that sets the priority of an incident based on its urgency and impact.

Table: Incident
When to Run: before
Update: true
Insert: false
Advanced: true

```
(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {
  var urgency = current.getValue('urgency');
  var impact = current.getValue('impact');
  
  if (urgency == 1 && impact == 1) {
    current.setValue('priority', 1); // High
  } else if (urgency == 1 && impact == 2) {
    current.setValue('priority', 2); // Medium
  } else if (urgency == 1 && impact == 3) {
    current.setValue('priority', 3); // Low
  } else if (urgency == 2 && impact == 1) {
    current.setValue('priority', 2); // Medium
  } else if (urgency == 2 && impact == 2) {
    current.setValue('priority', 3); // Low
  } else if (urgency == 2 && impact == 3) {
    current.setValue('priority', 4); // Planning
  } else if (urgency == 3 && impact == 1) {
    current.setValue('priority', 3); // Low
  } else if (urgency == 3 && impact == 2) {
    current.setValue('priority', 4); // Planning
  } else if (urgency == 3 && impact == 3) {
    current.setValue('priority', 4); // Planning
  }
})(current, previous);

```

### Insert

Here's an example of an Insert Business Rule in ServiceNow that automatically creates a task when a new incident is created.

Table: Incident
When to Run: after
Update: true
Insert: false
Advanced: true

```
(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {
  var task = new GlideRecord('task');
  task.initialize();
  task.short_description = 'New task created for incident ' + current.number;
  task.description = 'This task was created automatically when incident ' + current.number + ' was created.';
  task.assignment_group = current.assignment_group;
  task.assigned_to = current.assigned_to;
  task.priority = current.priority;
  task.insert();
})(current, previous);

```
### Query

Table: Incident
When to Run: before
Update: true
Insert: false
Advanced: true

```
(function executeBeforeQuery(current, previous /*null when async*/) {
  current.addQuery('state', '!=', '6');
})(current, previous);

```
In this example, the Business Rule is set to run before a query is executed on the Incident table. The script restricts the results of the query to only show incidents that have a value other than '6' in the 'state' field. The addQuery() method is used to add a filter to the query. The first parameter is the name of the field to filter on, the second parameter is the operator to use (in this case '!=', which means 'not equal to'), and the third parameter is the value to compare against
