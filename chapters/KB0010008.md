## 'Good Practices' for software development

While ServiceNow developers certainly have their own unique ways of doing things because of the nature of the platform, there are many practices that good developers from other fields use that ServiceNow folks should learn. 

### SOLID

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help guide software developers in writing maintainable and scalable code. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) and have become widely adopted in the field of software development. The SOLID acronym stands for the following principles:

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change. This principle states that a class should have a single responsibility or purpose, and that responsibility should be encapsulated within the class. By keeping classes focused on a single responsibility, code becomes more modular, easier to understand, and less prone to bugs.

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle promotes the use of abstraction and inheritance to create code that can be easily extended or modified without requiring changes to its core implementation. By adhering to this principle, new features can be added by writing new code rather than modifying existing code.

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. This principle emphasizes that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, derived classes should adhere to the same contract as the base class, ensuring that they can be used interchangeably.

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle states that interfaces should be fine-grained and specific to the needs of clients. It discourages creating large interfaces that encompass multiple unrelated functionalities. By adhering to this principle, clients can depend only on the interfaces that are relevant to them, reducing coupling and making the system more flexible.

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This principle suggests that the dependence between modules should be based on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. By depending on interfaces or abstract classes, rather than concrete classes, the code becomes more flexible, modular, and easier to test.

These SOLID principles collectively aim to improve the maintainability, scalability, and robustness of software systems by promoting good software design practices.

### DRY

The DRY principle is a well-established concept in software development, and its origins can be traced back to the book "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. In their book, they emphasize the importance of avoiding code duplication and promoting reusability and maintainability.

The DRY principle, standing for "Don't Repeat Yourself," is a fundamental concept in software development that encourages code reusability and maintainability. It suggests that developers should avoid duplicating code in a system and instead focus on creating reusable and modular components (Hunt & Thomas, 1999).

The principle suggests that when multiple parts of a system require the same functionality, that functionality should be extracted into a single, central location. This eliminates redundancy and establishes a single source of truth, making it easier to maintain and update the codebase (Hunt & Thomas, 1999).

Applying the DRY principle offers several benefits. Firstly, it enhances code maintainability by reducing the amount of code that needs to be modified when changes or bug fixes are required. Secondly, it improves code readability by eliminating duplication and making the intention of the functionality clearer. Thirdly, it promotes code reusability by creating modular components that can be leveraged across different parts of the system. Finally, it ensures consistency throughout the system, as any changes or updates made to the centralized code will reflect uniformly (Hunt & Thomas, 1999).

However, it's important to strike a balance between eliminating redundancy and maintaining simplicity. Blindly adhering to DRY without careful consideration can lead to overly complex code or premature abstractions. Developers should aim for readable, maintainable, and flexible code while applying the DRY principle appropriately (Hunt & Thomas, 1999)

### Code readability

Write code that is easy to read and understand. Use meaningful variable and function names, follow consistent formatting and indentation, and include comments where necessary. This enhances code maintainability and makes collaboration with other developers smoother.

Let me emphasize this word: 'maintainability.' 

The work we do in ServiceNow will be deployed to an enterprise platform used by a large number of people and supported by someone other than ourselves. When a thing breaks, the person fixing it should be given as many advantages as possible to help them figure out what went wrong.

Remember the saying (which is I know kind of extreme and funny but also kind of prescient and true), "Write your code as if the next developer to look at it is a psychopath who can still find you."

*How do we do this on ServiceNow projects teams?*

1. Take time to establish a team 'naming standard', probably documented in a Knowledge article somewhere, that defines how everyone should do things
2. Consider a guideline for differentiating between platform objects and new objects (such as prepending Business Rules with your company's name.)
3. Make GlideRecord query instantiations as unique as possible (such as var grClosedIncidents = new GlideRecord('incident').)
4. Use comments (be comfortable explaining why your code exists.)
5. But use them judiciously (do not write more comments than you write code for a thing.)

### Modular and decoupled design

Aim for modular and loosely coupled development by separating concerns and responsibilities. This promotes code reusability, testability, and scalability. Design patterns such as the SOLID principles can guide developers in achieving this goal.

*How do we do this on ServiceNow projects teams?*

This is tricky, since there are many ways of doing things in ServiceNow that are 'time savers' or built for the sake of consistency. Take the Service Catalog, for example.

When we build Catalog Items for the Service Catalog we are able to reuse variables by placing them in Variable Sets that are shared across several items. Similarly we can share Catalog Client scripts this way too. This saves time (see the DRY principal above), but does it create awkward or difficult dependencies? Generally speaking it useful to ask these questions:

Are you building a Script Include & Business Rule combination because it is good, reusble design thinking to do so, or are you doing it because your project has been architected with the idea of constructing a common code library in a Script Include? 

### Testing

Embrace a test-driven development (TDD) or behavior-driven development (BDD) approach. Write automated tests that cover different aspects of the codebase, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. This ensures code correctness, helps catch bugs early, and facilitates refactoring.

### Version control

Utilize version control systems like Git to track changes, collaborate with team members, and manage code versions effectively. Follow best practices such as committing atomic and logical changes, using descriptive commit messages, and branching strategies that fit your project's needs.

### Documentation

Document your code, APIs, and system architecture. This helps other developers understand how to use and interact with your code. Consider using tools like API documentation generators or maintaining a project wiki for comprehensive documentation.

### Code reviews

Engage in code reviews to receive feedback from peers and ensure code quality. Participate actively in reviewing others' code, providing constructive criticism, and learning from the insights of your colleagues. Code reviews help identify issues, share knowledge, and improve overall codebase quality.

### Performance optimization

Optimize code and algorithms for improved performance when necessary. Identify bottlenecks, profile your code, and use appropriate techniques to enhance efficiency. However, prioritize readability and maintainability unless performance is a critical requirement.

### Security considerations

Incorporate security practices into your development process. Be aware of common vulnerabilities, follow secure coding practices, and validate user input to prevent security breaches. Stay up to date with security best practices and consider security testing and code analysis tools.

### Continuous learning

Software development is a rapidly evolving field, so it's crucial to stay updated with new technologies, frameworks, and best practices. Engage in continuous learning through reading books, articles, and blogs, attending conferences or meetups, and exploring online learning resources.

### Effective communication

Good communication skills are essential for collaborating with team members, stakeholders, and clients. Clearly express your ideas, actively listen to others, and provide and receive feedback effectively. Strong communication fosters a productive and collaborative development environment.
