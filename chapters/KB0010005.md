## Agile Development (generated)

*What should you know before diving into this topic?*

You should be generally familiar with software development concepts, and having experience with working on a development team will be helpful. This subject is really geared toward a specific way of working, so if you are no coder, these concepts may seem very abstract.

*Why do we need to get into this?*

Even though learning the details of technical development in ServiceNow do not require project management, it certainly helps with planning projects. 

Agile Development methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer satisfaction. It involves breaking a large software development project into smaller, more manageable pieces or "sprints," and developing and testing each piece separately. The process is highly flexible and can adapt to changes in requirements, design, and testing as the project progresses.

Agile development methodology is based on the Agile Manifesto, a set of principles for software development that prioritize individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and response to change. Some of the key practices associated with Agile Development methodology include:

Scrum: A framework for managing and completing complex projects that involves regular meetings, daily standups, and the use of sprint backlogs and burn-down charts.

Kanban: A lean method for managing and improving work processes that involves visualizing work, limiting work-in-progress, and measuring lead time and cycle time.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Practices that involve integrating code changes frequently, testing them automatically, and deploying them to production quickly and reliably.

Pair Programming: A practice in which two programmers work together on a single workstation, collaborating on design, coding, testing, and documentation.

Test-Driven Development (TDD): A practice in which developers write automated tests before writing any code, and then use the tests to guide their development process.

Agile Development methodology has become popular in recent years due to its flexibility, speed, and ability to adapt to changing requirements and customer needs. It has been widely adopted in the software industry and is also used in other fields such as project management, marketing, and product development.

## Scrum

Scrum is an Agile framework for managing and completing complex software development projects. It is a lightweight, iterative approach that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and rapid delivery of working software. Scrum is based on the principles of the Agile Manifesto and was first introduced in the early 1990s.

The core of Scrum is the Scrum Team, which consists of a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, and a Development Team. The Product Owner is responsible for defining the product backlog, which is a prioritized list of features and requirements for the software being developed. The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that the Scrum process is followed and for removing any impediments that may be blocking the team. The Development Team is responsible for designing, developing, and testing the software.

Scrum projects are divided into short iterations called Sprints, typically 1-4 weeks in length. At the beginning of each Sprint, the Scrum Team conducts a Sprint Planning meeting, during which the team selects a set of items from the product backlog to work on during the Sprint. The team then works on these items, holding daily stand-up meetings to review progress, identify any impediments, and plan the work for the next day. At the end of each Sprint, the team conducts a Sprint Review meeting, during which they demonstrate the working software they have completed and gather feedback from stakeholders. The team also holds a Sprint Retrospective meeting, during which they reflect on the Sprint and identify areas for improvement.

Scrum provides a framework for managing software development projects in a flexible, collaborative way that enables teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and customer needs. It is widely used in the software industry and has been shown to be effective in improving team communication, productivity, and overall project success.

## User Stories

In the context of Scrum, a user story is a brief, informal description of a feature or requirement from the perspective of the end user or customer. User stories are a key component of Agile development methodologies, including Scrum, and are used to capture and prioritize requirements in a way that is easy to understand and communicate.

A user story typically consists of three parts: a brief description of the desired feature or functionality, the user or customer who needs the feature, and the goal or outcome that the user or customer hopes to achieve by using the feature. For example, a user story for a website might read:

"As a registered user, I want to be able to save items to my wishlist so that I can keep track of products I am interested in purchasing."

User stories are written from the perspective of the user or customer and are intentionally informal and flexible, to encourage collaboration and discussion between the development team and the stakeholders. They are typically written on index cards or sticky notes and are organized into a product backlog, which is a prioritized list of features or requirements that the development team works on during each Sprint.

User stories provide a way to ensure that development efforts are focused on delivering value to the end user or customer, and they enable the team to break down complex requirements into smaller, more manageable pieces. By using user stories, Scrum teams can prioritize requirements based on the value they provide to the user, and can deliver working software in a way that is responsive to changing needs and requirements.
