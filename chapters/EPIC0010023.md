# Roll Out Incident Management

## Introduction

Our organization is deploying the Incident Module in ServiceNow to enable IT Service Management for our organization. We will need to add users and groups, configure them for access, and ensure that they are able to work incidents in a manner consistent with  ITIL methodology.

This epic might not require a lot of coding, but it will provide a foundational background in setting up a module and ticking all the boxes for enabling the process for Incident in ServiceNow. Very often developers joining an organization arrive long after this has been done, and so those new to the platform may not have ever needed to dig into the details.
