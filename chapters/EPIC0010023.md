# Roll Out Incident Management

## The Project Pitch

Our organization is deploying the Incident Module in ServiceNow to enable IT Service Management for our organization. We will need to add users and groups, configure them for access, and ensure that they are able to work incidents in a manner consistent with  ITIL methodology.

This epic might not require a lot of coding, but it will provide a foundational background in setting up a module and ticking all the boxes for enabling the process for Incident in ServiceNow. Very often developers joining an organization arrive long after this has been done, and so those new to the platform may not have ever needed to dig into the details. 

## Developer Skills Needed: This is what you will practice

1. Creating users through the use of the Users, Groups, and Roles tables
2. Impersonating users to validate the results of your work
3. Configuring and reviewing outbound email on a PDI
4. Configure custom email notifications
5. Create assignment rules for incident management

## Good Practices

1. It is always best to provision roles through the use of groups, even in a test environment
2. No matter how simple the task you are asked to complete it is necessary to test the outcomes of your work through impersonation before saying your work is complete
3. Avoid modifying the content of out of the box elements -- even notifications. Instead create a new version with your customizations and deactivate the old version.
