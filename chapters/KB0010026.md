In ServiceNow, the Service Catalog is a self-service portal that provides users with a centralized location to browse, request, and track services offered by an organization. The Service Catalog contains various types of services, such as IT services, HR services, facilities services, and others, which can be requested by employees, customers, or other users.

The Service Catalog allows users to browse services by category, search for specific services, and view detailed information about each service, such as service descriptions, availability, fulfillment times, costs, and other details. Users can also submit service requests, track the status of their requests, and receive notifications when their requests are updated or completed.

Behind the scenes, the Service Catalog is powered by ServiceNow workflows, which automate the request and fulfillment process for each service. When a user submits a request, the ServiceNow system automatically assigns the request to the appropriate team or individual, tracks the progress of the request, and updates the user on its status.

Service Catalogs are an important feature of ServiceNow because they provide a centralized location for users to request services and for organizations to manage service requests. They also help to streamline the request and fulfillment process, making it faster and more efficient for users and reducing the workload for service providers.
