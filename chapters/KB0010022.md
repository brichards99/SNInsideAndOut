Part One: customizing your own user experience

In order to gain a little experience with the range of things users can do to make using the platform meet their individual needs we're going to step through a bunch of configurations simply by pointing and clicking. This is not a comprehensive set of choices, but it's pretty representative of the things users can do. Once we do this as a user, we'll build scripts to be able to do all this in an automated fashion. 

The exercises below should be fairly straightforward for someone who has passed the ServiceNow Systems Administrator course. 

First, do all this work as a regular user by first creating a non-admin ITIL user for yourself. This will be your companion persona as you develop things on your PDI, since an important aspect of delivering any development work is to ensure access for the users.
