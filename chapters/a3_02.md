## Client Script with Scratchpad

In ServiceNow, the scratchpad is a client-side data storage area that allows you to store data temporarily during the execution of a client script. It is a JavaScript object that is available within a client script and can be used to pass data between different functions within the same script.

The scratchpad is useful when you need to store data that is not related to a specific form field or record, or when you need to pass data between different client scripts that are running on the same page.

For example, you can use the scratchpad to store data that is needed for a subsequent AJAX call or for displaying data in a pop-up window. You can also use the scratchpad to store data that is needed across multiple client scripts.

To use the scratchpad, you can simply declare a variable in your client script and assign it to the scratchpad object. For example:
```
    var myData = {name: "John", age: 30};
    g_scratchpad.myData = myData;
```
In this example, the variable myData is assigned to the scratchpad object using the g_scratchpad global variable. The data can then be retrieved from the scratchpad in another function using the same global variable. For example:
```
    var retrievedData = g_scratchpad.myData;
```
Overall, the scratchpad is a convenient way to store and pass data between different functions within a client script, without having to rely on global variables or server-side storage.
