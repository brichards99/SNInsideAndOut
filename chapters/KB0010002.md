## IT Service Management (gemerated)

Your job as a developer might be all about building and fixing things, and most developers will keep their heads down and focus on doing just that. We are hired to fulfill contracts, implement changes and fixes, and generally make things work. I would argue, however, that the unique nature and complexity of ServiceNow implies that an even higher calling for us developers is that of ambassador. You're a go-between, a representative, and an advocate between the organization licensing the platform and the platform itself. 

Very lofty thinking, I know, but the reason I believe this is that I firmly believe that the vast majority of organizations licensing ServiceNow only take advantage of perhaps a third (and in many cases much less) of the capability they are paying for, and the reason for this is because they do not understand it. They do not understand what it can do, and they do not understand what purposes (and yes, that's importantly plural) it has been designed to serve.

I cannot prepare any individual to be an all-knowing advocate for the platform in this books (especially since I have so much to learn myself), but one area that I think it is crucial for all ServiceNow developers to master -- regardless of your field of specialization if you have one -- is IT Service Management. It is the most fundamental of the business needs that ServiceNow has been built to serve, and it is a bit of a model for most of the other things we do on the platform. On a more practical level, it is probably the most commonly implemented set of features. 

Know ITSM. Master it. Be an advocate for it, and be an expert on how ServiceNow makes it happen.

## The short, short version

The subject of ITSM is the way certain teams in a company provide IT services to the rest of the company. The first team everyone thinks of here is the helpdesk, but we can include the group that installs servers in the data center, the one that sets up the A/V equipment in the conference rooms, or that other group that manages the email server you use. These individual teams are called 'service centers', and service centers have a lot of different ways of interacting with the people who need them to do things. Some of their 'customers' are non-technical end users, and some of them are other service centers within the IT organization. IT Service Management is about helping each of these teams do their jobs well and work together in harmony while getting their 'customers' what they need.

## The Basics

IT Service Management (ITSM) is a structured approach to managing the work that information technology organizations do and ensuring that they meet the needs of the larger business. Here are the key things to know:

* The thing we want to make better is service delivery: ITSM places a strong emphasis on delivering IT services that meet the needs of the business. This is more than just setting up an email address that people can fire off requests for help to.  It's about providing repeatable, predictable ways of making technology work, helping the people who use it get what they need in a timely fashion, and making it all make sense in the big picture. This means that ITSM processes are designed to ensure that IT services are aligned with business objectives and are delivered in a way that maximizes their value.

One way to think about what makes good service delivery is that if we set it up well then the quality of service people get from the help desk (for example, since the help desk is certainly not the only 'service center' in a company) is not affected by the people who work there. You can have a jerk at the help desk or a genius, and good service delivery should produce pretty much the same outcomes.

* It's all about the process: we standardize the way things happen in an IT organization to ensure that IT services are delivered consistently and reliably. These processes cover all aspects of service delivery, from incident management and problem management to change management and service level management. Those are all key terms to learn, and they are generally speaking beyond the scope of this book to get into with much depth.

* Customer-centric approach: ITSM is customer-centric, meaning that it places the needs of the customer at the center of all IT service delivery activities. It's not a 'customer is always right' situation, however. Custom-centric service delivery reduces the work the service center (a term we use to descirbe the team that provides a given service to the rest of the company) has to do by keeping the customer informed before they need the service, updated as the service takes place, and tracked afterwards to learn if anything happened that can make the whole process better.

* Continuous improvement: we do not rest on good design. ITSM assumes that the delivery of services will be constantly feeding performance and optimization information back to the organization in order to create opportunities to refine those services. This includes eliminating services that are never used, renaming things so they make sense to the end users, changing the way requests are captured to be more efficient . . . everything is on the table.

*  Governance: It is important that someone is in charge of how service delivery happens, and ITSM sets up a framework for governance that keeps the trains running while simultaneously making all the things above happen as well. It is important to have this so that we can make sure that IT services are delivered in a way that is secure, compliant, and aligned with the organization's overall objectives.

ServiceNow fits into this field because it is a cloud-based platform with a pile of tools that help servce centers do all those things. It cannot do it in isolation, however, which is why it is valuable for developers to serve as ambassadors of sorts between the organization and the software. The organization has to be set up with an organization structure and a committment to ITSM before anybody logs into anything.

### Why is ITSM valuable for companies?

This part is a bit above and beyond what us developers do because now we're getting into the justifications for a company to drop the big licensing fees every year to pay for the platform and -- more importantly -- commit to the organizational change necessary to make ITSM happen. 

* Increased Efficiency: Over time IT organizations change, evolve, splinter, and merge in ways that eventually creates inefficiences. For example, the help desk might provide an efficient way for everyone to get help with their email, but if they want to at the same time figure why their password does not work the customer has to call a different hotline number. This kind of situation is not that unusual, and it is horribly inefficient. And frustrating. ITSM provides a framework for managing IT services in a way that is consistent and reliable can consolidate exactly this kind of situation. This can help large corporations to improve the efficiency of their IT service delivery processes, reducing the time and effort required to deliver IT services.

* Improved Service Quality: ITSM processes are designed to ensure that IT services are delivered in a way that meets the needs of the business. This can help groups to improve the quality of their IT services, ensuring that they are aligned with business objectives and delivered in a way that maximizes their value.

* Cost Reduction: ITSM can help organizations to reduce their IT service delivery costs by automating routine tasks and streamlining IT service delivery processes. This can help to reduce the cost of delivering IT services and improve the overall cost-effectiveness of the IT function.

* Risk Mitigation: ITSM provides a framework for managing IT services in a way that is secure and compliant with industry standards and regulations. This can help organizations to reduce the risk of IT-related incidents, such as security breaches or compliance violations.

* Increased Transparency: ITSM provides a centralized system for managing IT services, which can help to increase transparency and accountability within the IT function. This can help organizations to improve their reporting and decision-making processes, and ensure that IT services are delivered in a way that is aligned with business objectives.

Overall, ITSM can help organizations to improve the efficiency, quality, and cost-effectiveness of their IT service delivery processes, while also reducing risk and increasing transparency. This can help to improve the overall performance of the IT function and ensure that IT services are aligned with business objectives.

### What about for small companies?

Small companies can also benefit from implementing IT Service Management (ITSM) practices. Here are some reasons why:

Consistent and reliable IT services: Even small companies rely on IT services to run their business, and ITSM provides a framework for delivering these services in a consistent and reliable way. This can help small companies to avoid IT-related issues that can disrupt their operations, such as system downtime, slow response times, and data loss.

Better alignment with business objectives: ITSM processes are designed to align IT services with the needs of the business. This can help small companies to ensure that their IT services are supporting their business goals and objectives, rather than operating in silos or without a clear connection to the rest of the organization.

Improved communication and collaboration: ITSM emphasizes communication and collaboration between IT and other parts of the organization. This can help small companies to break down silos and improve cross-functional collaboration, leading to better decision-making and overall organizational performance.

Enhanced customer satisfaction: Small companies rely on customer satisfaction to grow and succeed, and ITSM provides a framework for delivering IT services that meet customer needs and expectations. This can help small companies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, leading to increased revenue and growth.

Reduced IT costs: While small companies may have smaller IT budgets than larger organizations, they still need to ensure that their IT services are cost-effective. ITSM provides a framework for streamlining and automating IT service delivery processes, which can help small companies to reduce their IT costs and maximize their IT investment.

In summary, small companies can benefit from implementing ITSM practices by improving the consistency and reliability of their IT services, better aligning IT with business objectives, enhancing communication and collaboration, improving customer satisfaction, and reducing IT costs.
