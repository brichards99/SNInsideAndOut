# Project: Developer Dashboard

Here's the idea: developers make a hell of a lot of changes on any given instance, and keeping track of those changes both in the short term and in the big picture can be really useful. In the short term it is a way of knowing what you have been working on today (and what damage you may have caused.) Over time it can be helpful to review things like what update sets you have created, what service accounts you are associated with, etc.
