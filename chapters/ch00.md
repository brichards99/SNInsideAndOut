# The Premise

There are a ton of resources available for learning ServiceNow development, and some are thorough and really helpful. My experience learning to development on the platform has shown me that I learn the most when I placed in what teachers call 'the zone of proximal development.' This is just a fancy word for that place you get to when you're learning to do something where you don't quite know how to proceed, but if you keep plugging away at it you'll figure it out on your own. When you're compelled to do this kind of problem solving you not only learn a lot, but you retain it pretty effectively.

This is the place I want this book to take you to.

There are three pools of working skills I want to address by writing this book the way I have:

* Good development skills
* Agile project management practices
* ServiceNow technical development skills

Good developments skills come from a lot of directions, and with this work there are some core tenets worth emphasizing, such as the DRY principle, or test-driven design, or designing for maintainability. I do not intend to provide a comprehensive approach to being a good developer here, but I intend to incorporate some of the practices I find particularly important throughout the book.

Agile project management is not required for ServiceNow development, but it's common enough among ServiceNow development teams that I think it's going to be really helpful to use to drive the work presented here. More on this in a minute.

ServiceNow technical development skills can be learned fairly thoroughly and easily from ServiceNow's NOW Learning site or from the many live instruction and only courses available to you thorugh the company. I cannot match the quality of their teaching. In my experience there seem to be a lot of people out there completely overwhelmed by the combination of the number of resources available and the breadth of the capabilities of the platform. In this book I want to deliver a solid baseline of development skills that I believe would be valuable for system administrators and developers alike to master, no matter what products within the platform they will ultimately be asked to support. As a matter of fact, I've split the book into two piles of projects: insdie and outside. 

* 'Inside', which is the second section of the book, demonstrates techniques that can be used for managing, investigating, and customizing the core platform and some of the ITSM modules such as Incident and Request. 

* The third section of the book is 'Outside', where we will take a shot at thinking outside of the box. In other words, custom application development that does not necessarily line up with any of the platform's modules, but which takes advantage of the sophisticated NOW Builder tools for developers.

# Scrum development and the projects ahead of you

Since this is a book and not a development team, we're not going to actually be able to use scrum development as it is really designed. It's been my experience, however, that it's not that uncommmon for development teams to pick and choose parts of the methodology as it suits their needs. So let's do that here too.

Here is what we're going to do:

1. The projects in this book are divided into epics
2. Each project is described in its own story
3. The story will describe what needs to be done and how I would characterize the work in terms of effort and outcomes.
4. At the end of each epic we will do a little sprint retrospective

Let's define our terms first:

## Agile

Agile development is a software development methodology that emphasizes self-organizing development teams, adapting requirements over time, and flexible, rapid delivery. There are several approaches to Agile development, and scrum is just one of them.

## Scrum 

One Agile approach is 'Scrum', which is consists of the following:

* Someone who has ownership of the project (called the 'product owner') maintains a big wish list of everything that the product owner wants to be done. This list is called the 'product backlog', and it can be added to over time. It also does not have to include things that can be done given current conditions -- hence a 'wish list.' Each item on the list is a discrete, clearly defined unit of work.
* The development team pulls from the product backlog a logical collection of items that can be done within a reasonable period of time, and this is called the 'sprint backlog'. The intention is that everything in the sprint backlog will actually be completed.
* The team does all of the work in the sprint backlog on a short timeline, perhaps two to four weeks, and which is called a 'sprint.' If necessary the sprint backlog can be split up over multiple consecutive sprints.
