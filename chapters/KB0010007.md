# ServiceNow 'Good Practices'

I hate the term 'best practices.' On many of the teams I have worked there is usually one person who is constantly striving to find out what are the 'best practices' for doing this or doing that, and that's a noble goal, I agree. Some organizations go so far as to install 'best practices analyzers' on their platforms in order to check the work of developers as they go and warn them about deviations from best practices.

It's annoying.

My experience has taught me that the best approach to ensuring reliable and quality work is to establish the organization's own standards for getting things done, and then training their developers and sysadmins to know ServiceNow thoroughly.

The goals are always the same: meet the business needs and deliver quality work. You do this by not making misakes, by refining things that behave poorly, and MOST IMPORTANTLY make sense for the team. 

For that last part I prefer the term 'good practices.' These are things developers and sysadmins can do to help each other do work that does what it is supposed to and is maintainable in the long term.

## Modifying Out of the Box Things



## Creating and Using Update Sets

## Disabling Things

## Coding Stuff


When making an object (BR, Client SCript, etc) inactive, comment the code itself in addition to making the object not 'Active' so that is clear for future sysadmins that this code should not be run for a reason. It is best to completely 'hobble' the code by commenting it out or adding a condition to prevent its execution.

Prepare a debugging 'template object' that you can copy and paste into code that you are debugging in order to build informative log messages.

Better yet, a good approach to debugging might be to apply an instance-wide strategy that uses application-specific system properties to 'enable' debugging, and refer to that property in business rules, script includes, etc, to determine if a logging message should be generated. This will allow you to leave your logging messages in the code even after the work goes to production.

When preparing large changes to out-of-box forms, plan your work carefully and consider creating custom Views instead of modifying the Default View. You can pair the custom View with a View Rule in order to achieve the desired result while saving yourself extra hassle at upgrade time.

Be comfortable creating lots of objects, but well-named ones. When a business rule (for example) contains elaborate conditional logic or does several different jobs it becomes very difficult to troubleshoot. 

In the same vein, when building business rules, be definitive about which rules affect the current record, which ones will modify other records, and which trigger other behaviors, such as events or workflows. This also makes debugging easier.
